This will be where I learn to make a 3D browser game in java script?

#Day 0:

 - [x] step one: make an object move across a canvas
 
 - [ ] New Quest: make the motion smooth
 - [ ] New Quest: add something to interact with
 - [ ] New Quest: radial axis
 - [ ] New Quest: add a new object that appears at a 
	psuedo random time

    
#Day 0+x:

 
 - [x] Quest Complete: make the motion smooth
 
    - [ ] New Quest: Use the momentum principle and conserve energy (model a key press a finite amount of thrust)
    - [ ] New Quest: use trigonometry to update the momentum relative to the angle of the thrust
 
 - [ ] Quest: add something to interact with
 - [ ] Quest: radial axis
 - [ ] Quest: add a new object that appears at a 
	psuedo random time
